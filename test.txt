Polycarp has a favorite sequence $$$a[1 \dots n]$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:

### Input ###

The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 300$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 300$$$) — the length of the sequence written on the whiteboard.

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2,\ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$) — the sequence written on the whiteboard.

### Output ###

Output $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer — is a sequence $$$a$$$ that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard.
